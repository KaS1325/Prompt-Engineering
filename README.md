## 📖 Overview
Prompt engineering is the process of designing effective prompts to guide the behavior and output of language models like ChatGPT. This repository includes:
- Designed prompts for various tasks like summarization, sentiment analysis, and text transformation.
- Simulated outputs (ideal for showcasing results without API usage).
- Example scripts and workflows to practice concepts.
