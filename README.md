**Prompt Engineering 101**

Welcome to Prompt Engineering 101! This repository is a hands-on learning project showcasing the art of prompt engineering with large language models (LLMs). Here, you'll find example prompts, simulated responses, and Python scripts to experiment with crafting effective inputs for AI models.

*üìñ Overview*
<p></p>
Prompt engineering is the process of designing effective prompts to guide the behavior and output of language models like ChatGPT. 
This repository includes:
-Designed prompts for various tasks like summarization, sentiment analysis, and text transformation.
-Simulated outputs (ideal for showcasing results without API usage).
-Example scripts and workflows to practice concepts.
